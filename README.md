# Object-Oriented-Programming

Jeff Lee, Southwest Technical College, Software Development

This repository exists to be able to store assignments and work on longer term projects in Object Oriented Programming.

My background is in web development but I'm learning Java Development to become a software engineer.

I'm taking this program to become employed in a different branch of the tech industry and enjoy the world of coding.
